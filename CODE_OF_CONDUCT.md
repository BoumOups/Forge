# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Introduction

I don't think it's necessary to write a long text about how a member who wants to get involved in this project should behave. But I'm going to do it anyway...

## The Rules

The rules are simple and the same as everywhere else: every user must respect and not disrespect any other users, whether within this project or any other. Be patient with each other and try to help as much as possible by offering constructive criticism and initiating debates and discussions. The goal of this project is to create a pleasant and enjoyable experience for everyone. If anyone's behavior becomes problematic and falls outside the bounds of what is acceptable, I will do my best to put a stop to it.

## Thanks

I would like to thank everyone who took the time to read this text. It is quite short, but as I said earlier, I didn't want to dwell on this subject, which I think is quite clear to many, and I hope that it will be enough to create a good atmosphere of collaboration within this crazy project...
