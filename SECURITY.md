## Reporting a Vulnerability
We strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities **privately**. Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security-related bugs.

To report a vulnerability:
1. Use the github built-in feature to report vulnerability.
2. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability.
3. Provide a Proof of Concept (PoC) script or steps to reproduce the issue.

### Our Response Process
* **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
* **Triage:** We will investigate the issue and determine the potential impact.
* **Fix:** If confirmed, we will work on a patch.
* **Disclosure:** Once the fix is released, we will give you credit for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous) and publish a security advisory.

## Disclosure Policy
We ask that you do not share information about a potential vulnerability publicly until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it. This "coordinated disclosure" helps protect all users of Forge.
